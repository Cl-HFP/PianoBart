# Emotion Classification

Dataset: EMOPIA

classify emotions into 4 classes with the EMOPIA dataset. The emotion of each clip has been labeled using the following 4-class taxonomy: ==HVHA (high valence high arousal); HVLA (high valence low arousal); LVHA (low valence high arousal); and LVLA (low valence low arousal)==.

valence indicates whether the emotion is positive or negative, and arousal whether it is high (e.g., angry) or low (e.g., sad).
